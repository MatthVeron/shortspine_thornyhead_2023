## Biological Data

### Natural Mortality

**THIS WILL BE UPDATED** 

@butler_1995 estimated the lifespan of `r spp` to exceed 100 years and suggested that M was likely less than 0.05. M may decrease with age as shortspine migrate ontogenetically down the slope to the oxygen minimum zone, which is largely devoid of predators for fish of their body size. The 2005 assessment fixed the natural mortality parameter at 0.05, while the 2013 assessment used a prior on natural mortality developed based on a maximum age of 100 years. The prior had a mean of 0.0505 and a standard deviation on a log scale of 0.5361 (Hamel, pers. comm.). For the base case, natural mortality was fixed at the mean of this prior distribution. This assessment uses an updated prior on M by @hamel_cope_2022, where the median of M is:
\begin{equation} \frac{5.40}{Age_{max}} \end{equation}

This assessment assumed the same maximum age of 100 as in the previous assessments, with an updated prior of 0.054 (median value) and log-space standard deviation = 0.31 [@hamel_cope_2022]. The 2023 assessment will explore estimating M and fixing M at the prior mean.

### Maturation and Fecundity

#### Maturity 
@pearson_gunderson_2003 estimated length at 50% maturity to be 18.2 cm on the West coast, with most females maturing between 17 and 19 cm. This was represented in the 2005 and 2013 assessments by the logistic function,
\begin{equation} M(L) = (1 + e^{-2.3(L-18.2)})-1\end{equation}

where L is the length in cm.

The 2013 assessment considered new (at the time) maturity information from ovaries collected for maturity analysis on the 2011 and 2012 WCGBTS. Histological analysis of those samples (M. Head, pers. comm.) indicated puzzling patterns of spawning by female size and by latitude, with a higher fraction of fish spawning in the north than in the south and a higher fraction of spawning fish in the 20-30cm than in the 30-40cm range. However, due to the complexity of these observed patterns and the known ontogenetic migrations of shortspine, samples collected in 2011 and 2013 were not considered adequate for estimation of a new representative maturity curve for the entire `r spp` population in 2013. Nonetheless, such a maturity curve was considered in a sensitivity analysis. On the basis of the sensitivity analysis, the 2013 assessment suggested that the slow but steady rate of growth for TEST `r spp`s, with growth still occurring at age 100, reduces the importance of assumptions about maturity because older individuals have significantly higher spawning output due to their much larger size, regardless of the fraction spawning.

New maturity analyses of samples collected on the \gls{s-wcgbt} in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2018 were available for the 2023 assessment (M. Head, pers. comm.). The larger number (N=397) and better spatial coverage of these samples allowed the use of statistical modeling to better understand the spatial variation in the proportion of female spawning.

In the 2013 assessment, the exploration of maturity analyses from the \gls{s-wcgbt} samples highlighted maturity gradients along latitude and depth. To assess a potential relationship between fish location and the shape of the maturity curve, a general linear model (GLM) was designed for estimating maturity curve parameters while integrating latitude and depth as covariates. This GLM consists of a logistic regression in which the functional maturity of samples, modeled with a Bernoulli distribution, is expressed as a linear combination of fish length, latitude, squared latitude, depth and squared depth of collection. Once fitted, the GLM was used to predict the response of the probability of being mature along the range of individual shortspine length considered in the model. For the 2023 assessment, this model prediction was made while setting the latitude and depth at the values of the center of gravity (using number of fish as weighing factor) of the population of `r spp` sampled during the \gls{s-wcgbt} to develop a single curve for the coastwide population assessment. Thus, this response of functional maturity to length was considered the mean maturity curve of the west coast `r spp` population. The parameters of the maturity curve L50 and k were arithmetically derived from this response to fish length. The new maturity curve is expressed as follows:

\begin{equation} M(L) = (1+e^{-2.3(L-31.42)})^{-1}\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:mat1} shows the fit of the maturity curve of the model per class of depth and latitude.

A sensitivity analysis will assess the impact of this change in the maturity curve on the model estimates by considering the newly estimated parameters, the Pearson and Gunderson‚Äôs relationship from the 2013, and one intermediate option (Figure \ref{fig:mat2}).

#### Fecundity 
The previous assessments assumed spawning biomass was equivalent to spawning output. The 2023 assessment will explore using fecundity-at-length parameters reported in @cooper_etal_2005, where fecundity was modeled as a power function of length. @cooper_etal_2005 estimated the fecundity of 54 females collected from the West Coast and Alaska. The study found no difference in the length-fecundity relationship by region and pooled the samples. The fecundity-at-length parameters in that study were:
\begin{equation} F = 0.0544L_{3.978} \end{equation}
where F is fecundity in the number of eggs per female and  L is length in cm. Fecundity information from @cooper_etal_2005 suggests that fecundity increases at a faster rate with length than body weight with length. This means larger females are likely to have greater relative fecundity compared to small females (i.e., large females produce more eggs per kg of body weight). This assessment will explore modeling a fecundity-at-length relationship using the fecundity parameters from @cooper_etal_2005 and scaling the fecundity intercept by one million in SS3 to report fecundity in billions of eggs.

Uncertainty remains in the spawning strategy of `r spp`. @cooper_etal_2005 and @pearson_gunderson_2003 found no evidence for batch spawning in this species (i.e., a determinate, total spawning strategy). However, updated histology information suggests a possibility of batch spawning in this species (Melissa Head, NWFSC, pers. comm.). Batch spawning could influence the fecundity-at-length relationship if not properly accounted for and should be a focus of future research. The histology analysis also found evidence of parasites in the ovaries and atresia (degrading eggs), which could influence fecundity (Melissa Head, NWFSC, pers. comm.). 

### Length-Weight Relationship
Fisheries-independent length and weight specimen data are available from the \gls{s-aslope} (1997, 1999-2001; N=7,623) and the \gls{s-wcgbt} (2003-2021, excluding 2020; N=20,142). The \gls{s-wcgbt} data were used to estimate the length-weight relationship because it has the largest sample size and covers the greatest spatiotemporal resolution. The allometric function models weight (W) as an exponential function of length (L), where:

\begin{equation} W = \alpha L^{\beta} \end{equation}

This function can be linearized by taking the natural logarithm of both sides. The predicted weight-at-length values were bias-corrected using a multiplier of ùúé2 / 2. Length-weight was estimated for both sexes in R using the lm() function [@r_core_2021]. 

The resulting allometric parameters for 2023 (females: $\alpha$ = 6.49e-6, $\beta$ = 3.18; males: $\alpha$ =6.71e-6, $\beta$=3.17) were similar to the 2013 assessment values, which estimated a single length-weight relationship for males and females combined using \gls{s-wcgbt} data through 2012 (sexes combined: $\alpha$ = 4.77e-6, $\beta$=3.26). The $\beta$ value was higher in the 2013 assessment, indicating a slightly higher weight-at-length for longer fish. We found no temporal trend in the available data and were unable to account for these small differences in results. The available data suggest that length-weight is highly conserved in `r spp`; therefore, no sensitivity analysis was conducted for this set of parameters in the 2023 assessment.

### Growth (Length-at-Age)
No validated ageing methodology currently exists for `r spp`; therefore, this species is not aged by the \gls{nwfsc} or \gls{swfsc} and length-at-age data are limited for this stock assessment. Two research age datasets exist for `r spp` in the West Coast region: (1) @kline_1996 includes 319 unsexed fish collected from Monterey Bay in central California in 1991, and (2) @butler_1995 includes 1,023 sexed fish collected in the waters off northern California and Oregon in 1978-1988 and 1990. The Kline specimens were aged by one age reader, and lengths were reported as total lengths, whereas the Butler specimens were aged independently by two separate age readers, and lengths are reported in fork length. The Butler data age data presented in this assessment are the mean ages between the two age readers. 

The length-at-age curve developed in the 2005 stock assessment and used again in 2013 was based on a Schnute parameterization of the Von-Bertalanffy growth function fit to the Kline data. The resulting parameter estimates for this growth function were as follows: growth rate k was 0.018 for both males and females length at age-2 was 7 cm for both males and females, and length at age-100 was 67.5 cm for males and 75 cm for females based on the assumption that the asymptotic length for males should be 90% of the asymptotic length for females [@hamel_2005]. The data and associated analysis from 2005 were lost; however, the original Kline and Butler datasets were obtained for use in this assessment (Donna Kline, pers. comm., March 2023). Using these newly obtained data, we could not reproduce the parameters used in the 2005 assessment. 

Because the Butler data were sex-specific, had a higher sample size, were aged by two readers instead of one, and were collected from a larger geographic area and over more years compared to the Kline data, we determined that Butler was the preferred dataset to estimate the length-at-age relationship for the 2023 stock assessment. We fit sex-specific Schnute growth functions to the Butler data:

\begin{equation} \hat{L}_{a} = L_{a_{1}}+\frac{(L_{a_{2}}-L_{a_{1}})(1-exp(-k(a_{2}-a_{1})))}{(1-exp(-k(a_{2}-a_{1})))}\end{equation}

where:
$L_{a_{1}}$ and $L_{a_{2}}$ are the lengths at reference ages $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ where $a_{1}=1$;$a_{2}=100$ and k is the growth rate. Growth curve estimation was conducted in R using the optim() function [@r_core_2021]. Errors were assumed to be lognormally distributed and predicted length-at-age was bias-corrected using a multiplier of $\frac{\sigma_2}{2}$.

`r Spp` are slow-growing fish that appear to continue to grow throughout their lifespan (i.e., the growth curve does not asymptote). The new growth curves estimated using the Bulter dataset exhibited similar trends to those assumed in the 2005 and 2013 assessments (Figure \ref{fig:growth_LAA1}). The male curves were almost identical, with the 2005/2013 curve exhibiting slightly lower length-at-age at young ages and slightly higher length-at-age at older ages. The 2005/2013 female curve was defined by a higher growth rate, leading to the higher length-at-age in the intermediate age range.

Two alternative sensitivity analyses were developed for the 2023 assessment. During the exploratory data analysis phase, we found that specimens collected in the Kline study exhibited higher size-at-age when compared to the Butler specimens (Figure \ref{fig:growth_LAA2}). It is unknown if these differences should be attributed to spatial differences in growth between central California and northern California/Oregon, bias among age readers, or discrepancies between the total and fork length measurements (Donna Kline, pers. comm., March 2023). In order to account for this alternative growth pattern, we increased the lengths at ages 2 and 100 by 25% in the upper sensitivity analysis (Figure \ref{fig:growth_LAA2}). The lower sensitivity analysis was defined by decreasing the lengths at ages 2 and 100 by 10% from the base model.
