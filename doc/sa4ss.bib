	abstract = {Stock Synthesis ({SS}) is an age- and size-structured assessment model in the class of models termed integrated analysis models. {SS} has a population sub-model that simulates a stock’s growth, maturity, fecundity, recruitment, movement, and mortality processes, an observation sub-model estimates expected values for various types of data, a statistical sub-model characterizes the data’s goodness of fit and obtains best-fitting parameters with associated variance, and a forecast sub-model projects needed management quantities. {SS} outputs the quantities, with confidence intervals, needed to implement risk-averse fishery control rules. The model is coded in C++ with parameter estimation enabled by automatic differentiation (admb). Windows, Linux, and {iOS} versions are available. Output processing and associated tools are in R, and a graphical interface is in {QT}. {SS} is available from {NOAA}’s {VLAB}. The rich feature set in {SS} allows it to be configured for a wide range of situations. {SS} has become the basis for a large fraction of U.S. assessments and many other assessments around the world.},

Moreover, early life history information is sparse for many species. We used data from 14 microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic structure of young-of-the-year Pacific ocean perch collected during 1998–2003 from the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. Broad-scale geographic variation in genetic structure of the young-of-the-year (FST = 0.005, P {\textless} 10−4) had similarities to that observed in a previous adult study. The overall correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation by distance) was nearly identical to that observed in the adults. Fine-scale geographic divergence was also observed and may be the result of oceanographic circulation features within the Gulf of Alaska. Interannual variation (between cohorts) at locations sampled in more than one year is consistent with variable oceanography and fine-scale population structure rather than the influence of a sweepstakes effect. The similarities of the young-of-the-year with the adults and the pattern of genetic divergence confirm that dispersal of Pacific ocean perch is limited in all life stages.},

The sampling procedure has been to tow the dredge for 5 min at 0.77 m/s (i.e., 1.5 kn), which gives a nominal tow distance of 232 m. This indirect calculation does not include any sampling that may take place when the dredge is being set out or retrieved. To get a direct estimate of distance sampled, we placed sensors and a camera on the dredge to monitor bottom contact and towing speed. A total of 70 tows was made in May 1997 across a range of depths, typical of those made during clam surveys, and at a range of tow speeds and scopes (i.e., ratio of tow line length to bottom depth). For each tow, we counted the number of clams captured and estimated the distance sampled based directly on the sensor data. Actual distance sampled per tow was often 1.5–3 times greater than the nominal distance (timed tow), and tow distance increased with water depth. This occurred because the dredge sampled the bottom when it was being set out and hauled back to the ship. Consideration of actual tow distance changed conclusions regarding the effect of scope on catch rate of surfclams. In addition, data on tow distance and catch per tow allowed us to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the two clam species using a negative binomial model. Our findings suggest that estimating tow distances directly can improve estimates of biomass in clam resource surveys.},

The age-based process caused bias in the estimates of growth parameters assuming random at length, even when relatively few age classes were affected. Methods that assumed random at age were biased by the subsequent inclusion of the length-based process of gear selection. Additional knowledge of the age structure of the sampled area is needed to ensure an unbiased estimate of the growth parameters when using the length-conditional approach in the presence of age-based movement. Estimates of the variability in the length-at-age relationship were better estimated with the length-conditional than the traditional method even when the assumptions of random at length were violated. Inclusion of paired observations of length and associated age inside the population dynamics model may be the most appropriate way of estimating growth.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and applied research suggests that survival rates during early life stages will increase when spawning biomass is reduced in marine fishes (termed 'recruitment compensation'). However, the magnitude of recruitment compensation is generally difficult to estimate for individual fish stocks, and its average value for marine fishes remains highly contested. Scientists and managers for Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) on the US West Coast have used a regional meta-analysis to estimate the likely distribution of the steepness parameter of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship using stock assessment models since 2007, and the method has been updated every two years as new assessments are conducted (i.e., five biennial updates). Here, we provide a short history of this approach, its methodological assumptions, changes in results over time, and ongoing efforts to validate its assumptions. While the regional meta-analysis has been successful in ensuring a consistent approach to treatment of steepness across assessments, the estimates of mean steepness have been unexpectedly variable as the meta-analysis has been updated. Specifically, we show that the estimated average value of steepness for West Coast rockfish increased markedly from 2007 (average: {\textless} 0.6) to 2011 (average: {\textgreater} 0.75), before decreasing somewhat again in the 2017 update. We also show that this value has a strong impact on rockfish rebuilding plans, and showcase the example of canary and widow rockfishes, where the estimated rates of rebuilding are strongly influenced by the assumed value of steepness. We conclude by discussing the bias variance tradeoff between using global and regional meta-analysis, as well as the likely implications of difficult-to-validate assumptions including: (1) no recruitment autocorrelation within each stock; (2) no correlations among stocks; and (3) no bias from individual stocks resulting from mis-specification of the stock assessment models used in the meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {Patterns in the distribution and abundance of upper continental slope demersal fishes off central California were studied using a bottom trawl and newly-developed camera sled. From May 1984 through May 1985, seven cruises were conducted off Point Sur, California (36\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}circ\$ 15-31\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}prime\$ N, 122\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}circ\$ 4-26\${\textbackslash}sp{\textbackslash}prime\$ W). The camera sled permitted accurate quantification of the distribution and abundance of fishes as well as direct observation of the slope habitat. Sampling was conducted along bathymetric contours at 200-m intervals from 200 to 1,600 m. The number of species identified from trawls was relatively constant at ca. 20 for four 200-m depth intervals from 400 to 1,000 m, but decreased below 1,000 m to a minimum at 1,600 m. A faunal break between 400 and 600 m corresponds to a transition between shelf- and slope-dwelling species. The sediment-covered sea floor off Point Sur is characterized by a number of sharp environmental boundaries that in some instances correspond to marked changes in the abundance of a given species of fish. On a slope-wide basis, Sebastolobus altivelis, was the numeric and gravimetric dominant. Other important taxa, either in terms of numbers or biomass, included Eptatretus deani, Sebastolobus alascanus, Microstomus pacificus, Coryphaenoides acrolepis, Albastrossia pectoralis, Anoplopoma fimbria, Antimora microlepis, and Lycenchelys spp. Total fish biomass was relatively constant between 400 and 1,000 m, and decreased below 1,000 m to a minimum at 1,600 m.    Specific emphasis was placed on the life-history of Sebastolobus altivelis and the importance of this dominant species in the vertical transport of particulate matter along the continental margin during its ontogenetic vertical migration. Studies on reproduction in adult S. altivelis and settlement in their juveniles were conducted. The production of particulate organic matter ({POM}) in buoyant masses of eggs and the recruitment of {POM} by settling juveniles were determined as measures of the passive upward flux of {POM} and active transport of {POM} back to the sea floor. Fluxes of particulate organic carbon associated with planktonic development and ontogenetic migration of S. altivelis were 4.1 to 5.8 and 3.0 to 5.5 mg C m\${\textbackslash}sp\{-2\}\$ yr\${\textbackslash}sp\{-1\}\$, respectively. These upward and downward fluxes are lower by a factor of about 10 and 10\${\textbackslash}sp4\$, respectively, than reported passive upward and active downward fluxes measured with particle interceptor traps in the eastern North Pacific.},

	abstract = {As petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) is a valuable groundfish harvested in the California Current, proper ageing is important for its assessment and management. This study presents the first bomb radiocarbon reference chronology for the California Current and petrale sole age validation. Break-and-burn and surface ages are negatively biased by approximately 1 year and 2–3 years, respectively. The reference and validation curves are more variable and show a lag in the rate of radiocarbon increase in comparison to most other time series of bomb radiocarbon in marine systems. Upwelling in the California Current produces a lagged rate of increase in radiocarbon levels owing to the introduction and mixing of radiocarbon-depleted deep waters with surface waters that interact with the atmosphere. The variable and lagged rate of radiocarbon increase in the petrale sole data may be due to their spending a substantial portion of their first year of life in areas subject to variable upwelling, illustrating the importance of using reference curves for age validation that are region and species specific when possible.},

Sablefish recruitment is related to large-scale climate forcing indexed by regionally correlated sea level (SL) and zooplankton communities that pelagic young-of-the-year sablefish feed upon. This study forecasts trends in future sablefish productivity using SL from Global Climate Models (GCMs) and explores the robustness of harvest control rules (HCRs) to climate driven changes in recruitment using management strategy evaluation (MSE). Future sablefish recruitment is likely to be similar to historical recruitment but may be less variable. Most GCMs suggest that decadal SL trends result in recruitments persisting at lower levels through about 2040 followed by higher levels that are more favorable for sablefish recruitment through 2060. Although this MSE suggests that spawning biomass and catches will decline, and then stabilize, into the future under both HCRs, the sablefish stock does not fall below the stock size that leads to fishery closures.},

	abstract = {Oceanographic processes and ecological interactions can strongly influence recruitment success in marine fishes. Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatiotemporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from prespawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40°N–50°N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.},

	abstract = {The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the management of living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas, the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal stocks often support recruitment., An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat restoration and conservation of genetic resources., The new management framework requires co-management and collective decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks imposing non-discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion. Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a favourable regime., In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time- and area-specific access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of vessel operations, even offshore., More fundamentally, the basic axiom of ‘enlightened self interest’ underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a 'common currency' for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and 'design principles' for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive SpatioTemporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatiotemporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves 'species ordination' of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a 'common currency' approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

Here, we use a simulation framework to show that temporal changes in selectivity, natural mortality, and growth can induce retrospective patterns in integrated, age-structured models. We explore the potential effects on retrospective patterns of catch history patterns, as well as model misspecification due to not accounting for time-varying biological parameters and selectivity. We show that non-zero values for Mohn’s r (a common measure for retrospective patterns) can be generated even where there is no model misspecification, but the magnitude of Mohn’s r tends to be lower when the model is not misspecified. The magnitude and sign of Mohn’s r differed among life histories, with different life histories reacting differently from each type of temporal change. The value of Mohn’s r is not related to either the sign or magnitude of bias in the estimate of terminal year biomass. We propose a rule of thumb for values of Mohn’s r which can be used to determine whether a stock assessment shows a retrospective pattern.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates environmental drivers of US west coast petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) recruitment as an initial step towards developing an environmental recruitment index that can inform the stock assessment in the absence of survey observations of age-0 and age 1-fish. First, a conceptual life-history approach is used to generate life stage- and spatio-temporally-specific mechanistic hypotheses regarding oceanographic variables that likely influence survival at each life stage. Seven life history stages are considered, from female-spawner condition through benthic recruitment as observed in the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (age-2 fish). The study area encompasses the region from 40-48 °N in the California Current Ecosystem. Hypotheses are tested using output from a regional ocean reanalysis model outputs and model selection techniques. Four oceanographic variables explained 73\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by estimates based exclusively on the spawning stock size. Recruitment deviations were (1) positively correlated with degree days during the female precondition period, (2) positively correlated with mixed-layer depth during the egg stage, (3) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the larval stage, and (4) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the benthic juvenile stage. While multiple mechanisms likely affect petrale sole recruitment at different points during their life history, the strength of the relationship is promising for stock assessment and integrated ecosystem assessment applications.},

In this analysis, the reproductive strategy for this species was revisited, fecundity estimates were updated, and size-d­ependent fecundity relationships were established from fish collected off California and the Pacific Northwest. Results of histological analysis indicate that petrale sole exhibit a determinate batch spawning strategy, with potential annual fecundity (PAF) set prior to the release of eggs over the course of several spawning events. Both PAF and relative PAF (weight-s­ pecific fecundity) increased significantly with maternal length and weight. Regional differences in the strength of the relationship between relative PAF and size indicate that the maternal effect is stronger in the Pacific Northwest; however, more data are necessary to confirm regional patterns. Because reproductive output was not proportionate with female size, fisheries managers should consider using relative PAF in determining the reproductive potential of this stock.},

abstract = {The natural mortality rate M is a key parameter in estimating the productivity of a fish stock. However, it is quite difficult to estimate given its correlation with other parameters, variation in processes governing population dynamics and data acquisition, as well as other factors such as ageing error. Meta-analytical approaches relating M to other life history parameters are often used to provide an estimate and/or Bayesian prior for M. Longevity is the one of these life history parameters most directly related to M. The maximum observed or estimated age serves as a proxy for longevity in predicting, or developing a prior for, M to be used within a stock assessment or other population model. Consideration of the age data and factors that might influence its quality for determining a maximum age is important in using a meta-analytically derived relationship between maximum age and M, though these factors are not completely absent from the data used to develop that relationship. Here, we discuss these issues, propose a relationship between maximum age and M, and develop an updated prior for M based upon maximum age.},

Both species spawn pelagic gelatinous egg masses, although timing differs between taxa and locations. Shortspines spawn between April and July in Alaska and between December and May along the West Coast. Longspines spawn between January and April along the West Coast. Length at 50\% maturity differed between species and areas, with shortspines at 21.48cm in Alaska and 18.19cm on the West Coast, and longspines at 17.83cm on the West Coast. We used the gonadosomatic index to estimate instantaneous rates of natural mortality (M). Values of M differed little between species and areas despite substantial differences in temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Estimates for shortspines from both Alaska and the West Coast ranged between 0.013 and 0.017, while longspines from the West Coast showed an M value of 0.015. Such low estimates of M suggest Sebastolobus are extremely long-lived.},

abstract = {Scientific survey data are used to estimate abundance trends for fish populations worldwide, and are frequently analyzed using delta-generalized linear mixed models (delta-GLMMs). Delta-GLMMs incorporate information about both the probability of catch being non-zero (catch probability) and the expected value for non-zero catches (catch rates). Delta-GLMMs generally incorporate year as a main effect, and frequently account for spatial strata and/or covariates. Many existing delta-GLMMs do not account for random or systematic differences in catch probability or rates in particular combinations of spatial strata and year (i.e., space–time interactions), and do not recognize potential correlation in random space–time interactions between catch probability and catch rates. We therefore develop a Bayesian delta-GLMM that estimates correlations between catch probability and rates, and compare it with either (a) ignoring year–strata interactions, (b) modeling year–strata interactions as fixed effects, or (c) estimating year–strata interactions in catch probability or rates as independent random effects. These four models are fitted to bottom trawl survey data for 28 species off the U.S. West Coast. The posterior median of the correlation is positive for the majority (18) of species, including all five for which the posterior distribution has little overlap with zero. However, estimating this correlation has little impact on resulting abundance indices or credible intervals. We therefore conclude that the correlated random model will have a little impact on index standardization of the West Coast bottom trawl dataset. However, we propose that the correlated model can quickly identify correlations between occupancy probability and density, and provide our code to allow researchers to quickly identify whether such a correlation is likely to be significantly different from zero for their chosen data set.}

    abstract = "{Indices of abundance are the bedrock for stock assessments or empirical management procedures used to manage fishery catches for fish populations worldwide, and are generally obtained by processing catch-rate data. Recent research suggests that geostatistical models can explain a substantial portion of variability in catch rates via the location of samples (i.e. whether located in high- or low-density habitats), and thus use available catch-rate data more efficiently than conventional “design-based” or stratified estimators. However, the generality of this conclusion is currently unknown because geostatistical models are computationally challenging to simulation-test and have not previously been evaluated using multiple species. We develop a new maximum likelihood estimator for geostatistical index standardization, which uses recent improvements in estimation for Gaussian random fields. We apply the model to data for 28 groundfish species off the U.S. West Coast and compare results to a previous “stratified” index standardization model, which accounts for spatial variation using post-stratification of available data. This demonstrates that the stratified model generates a relative index with 60\\% larger estimation intervals than the geostatistical model. We also apply both models to simulated data and demonstrate (i) that the geostatistical model has well-calibrated confidence intervals (they include the true value at approximately the nominal rate), (ii) that neither model on average under- or overestimates changes in abundance, and (iii) that the geostatistical model has on average 20\\% lower estimation errors than a stratified model. We therefore conclude that the geostatistical model uses survey data more efficiently than the stratified model, and therefore provides a more cost-efficient treatment for historical and ongoing fish sampling data.}",

	abstract = {Learmonth Bank in northern British Columbia sustains an active trawl fishery that returns large bycatches of deep-sea sponges and corals. To examine effects of biogenic structures on the distribution of fish, we examined nearly 30 km of high-definition imagery from a remotely operated vehicle and documented locations of 2770 scorpaenid fish. The 2 local genera have similar abundances, averaging about 1.2 individuals 100 m–2, but have different spatial abundance patterns: shortspine thornyhead Sebastolobus alascanus are randomly distributed on featureless substrata and their abundance increases with depth. Rockfish Sebastes spp. associate with higher seafloor relief nonrandomly and select for sponges and corals over the inert substrata alone; 95\% of the rockfish occurred on 27\% of the seafloor surveyed. Sponges (Demospongia and Hexactinellida) were abundant on the bedrock and boulders of the bank and adjacent moraine and covered 30 to 55\% of the seafloor compared with 1\% of the sediment and aggregates of the surrounding basin. The majority of rockfish (80\%) occurred with sponges ≥ 50 cm in height, and even beds of short sponges attracted 4 times as many rockfish than did substrata with no large epifauna. While over half of primnoid corals over 30 cm tall had associated rockfish, less than 2\% of the seafloor had large coral, and small coral had no associated rockfish. On the adjacent seafloor with past trawling activity, Primnoa pacifica was 13 times less abundant, and large corals and sponges were rare. Thornyhead abundance doubled but rockfish had a 3-fold reduction in numbers. Our study indicates that degradation of biogenic structures is a long-term detriment to rockfish species and, although the mechanism remains unclear, our data suggest it occurs through the destruction of a habitat that is more effective for shelter than rough inert seafloor.},

Comparisons are made among the shortspine thornyhead (S. alascanus) (from seven locations), the longspine thornyhead (S. altivelis) (from five sites), which are sympatric in the northeast, and the broadbanded thornyhead (S. macrochir) (a single site) from the northwest. Phylogenetic trees rooted to Sebastes show that S. macrochir is the sister taxon of S. alascanus and S. altivelis. Intraspecific genetic variability is appreciable, with most individuals having unique haplotypes. Gene flow is substantial among some locations and others diverged significantly. Genetic divergences among sampling sites for S. alascanus indicate an isolation by geographic distance pattern. Genetic divergences for S. altivelis are unrelated to the hypothesis of isolation by geographic distance and appear to be more consistent with the hypothesis of larval retention in currents and gyres. Differences in geographic genetic patterns between the species are attributed to life history differences in their relative mobilities as juveniles and adults.},

	abstract = {Shortspine thornyhead Sebastolobus alascanus are widely distributed along the eastern Pacific coast and are assessed as a demographically homogeneous stock off the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington. The validity of this assumption has been questioned because data suggest complex ontogenetic movements. Otolith microchemistry applied to immature fish was used to determine the age of settlement and the population structure of S. alascanus. Samples were collected from 2011−2013 from bottom trawl surveys in 5 areas along the coasts of (1) Washington, (2) northern Oregon, (3) southern Oregon and northern California, (4) central California and (5) southern California. The Ba:Ca ratio, measured from the primordium to the margin of otoliths, corresponds to the pelagic and benthic phases of immature fish. This ratio decreased steadily before the formation of the first annulus and increased thereafter. Water masses along the bathymetric gradient mostly correlated with the distribution of otolith trace element (Mg:Ca, Ba:Ca) and stable isotope (δ18O and δ13C) ratios on the continental shelf. These results indicate that the population of immature fish belongs to 2 distinct groups, distributed north and south of Cape Mendocino. Accordingly, the performance of a k-nearest-neighbor classifier was highest when structured based on these 2 regions, with 94 and 69\% cross-validated classification accuracy, respectively into the northern and southern groups. These results confirm that S. alascanus settle after nearly 1 yr of pelagic life and show that otolith chemistry can be used to test critical hypotheses regarding the migration and population structure of this species.},

Secondary oocyte development takes place on the ends of vascularized peduncles that are protrusions of the ovarian stroma. A gelatinous material is simultaneously secreted into the ovarian lumen by a single row of specialized cells that line the ovary wall.

have not allowed a full examination of the environmental basis for metabolic adaptation. The objective of this study was to determine the bathymetric demography of 22 scorpaenid fishes of the genera \textit{Sebastes} and \textit{Sebastolobus}, and to examine
inter- and intra-specific changes in metabolic capacity in 4 of them \textit{(Sebastes goodei}, \textit{Sebastes diploproa},\textit{ Sebastolobus alascanus} and \textit{Sebastolobus altivelis) }representative of different environmental conditions. We attempted to
collect samples that spanned the full depth and size ranges of each species. We examined changes in metabolic capacity as it was affected by size, depth of occurrence, and the existence of an oxygen minimum zone ({OMZ}) centered at 800 m. Lactate
dehydrogenase ({LDH}) was measured as an indicator of glycolytic capacity. Citrate synthase ({CS}), a Krebs cycle enzyme, was measured as an indicator of aerobic capacity. Malate dehydrogenase ({MDH}), an enzyme which helps maintain redox balance between the
mitochondrion and cytosol, was also used as an indicator of aerobic capacity. When normalized to a common size, \textit{S. goodei}, \textit{S. diploproa},\textit{ S. alascanus} and \textit{S. altivelis} displayed an inter-specific pattern of declining metabolic
activity with depth of occurrence. Intra-specific size scaling of glycolytic capacity ({LDH}) was positive in the shallow-living\textit{ S. goodei}. However, no scaling occurred in \textit{S. diploproa} and \textit{S. alascanus}, and negative scaling of
glycolytic activity occurred in the deep-living \textit{S. altivelis.} {MDH} did not scale in \textit{S. goodei} and \textit{S. diploproa} but was negative in the 2 deeper-living \textit{Sebastolobus }species. {CS} activity scaled negatively in \textit{S. goodei},
\textit{S. alascanus}, and \textit{S. altivelis,} but the deep-water specialist, \textit{S. altivelis}, had the steepest slope. \textit{S. altivelis} was the only species where similar-sized individuals could be compared over a wide depth range. There was no
elevation of {LDH}, or increase in anaerobic poise, in response to the hypoxia of the {OMZ}. Rather, all 3 enzyme activities were highest at 600 m and generally declined with increasing depth. Contrary to the existing paradigm,\textit{ S. alascanus} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}S.
altivelis{\textless}/i{\textgreater} were not found to be shallow- and deep-living congeners. Rather, \textit{S. altivelis }is a permanent resident of deep water, while \textit{S. alascanus} settles in shallow water then migrates to deep water with the onset of sexual maturity.
When living in deep water, the supposed shallow water species, \textit{S. alascanus, }maintains higher activities of all enzymes and grows an order of magnitude larger ({\textgreater}5000 vs {\textless}500 g). In deep-water slope habitats expected patterns of allometric scaling
of white muscle enzyme activities appear to be altered by the limitations of food and oxygen availability, a pattern previously observed in flatfishes.},

The estimated ages (counts of presumed annual growth zones in the otoliths) were then evaluated with bomb-produced radiocarbon (14C) and Bayesian modelling with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. This study successfully demonstrated the level of accuracy in estimated ages of redstripe rockfish (a 35\% probability of underageing, and {\textasciitilde}5\% probability of overageing) and harlequin rockfish (a 100\% probability that they were underaged by {\textasciitilde}3 or 4 years). Measured Δ14C in shortspine thornyhead and shortraker rockfish otoliths was lower and increased later than expected. Hence, incorrect age determination could not be evaluated. This is likely caused by dissimilar environmental and biological availability of 14C between these two species and the Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) reference chronology, or underageing of these two species.},

We studied the bathymetric demography and ecology of both species off Oregon and central California. Thornyhead species cannot be characterized as shallow- and deep-living congeners because the peak spawning biomass for both occurred in the oxygen minimum zone at 600–1000 m. Small shortspine thornyhead (≤10 cm) were found in shallow water (200–600 m) but migrated into deeper water with growth. Longspine thornyhead were oxygen minimum zone specialists found only in deep water (600–1400 m). Shortspine thornyhead grew larger ({\textgreater}70 cm) and appeared to grow throughout their lives. Longspine thornyhead were smaller (25–30 cm) and appeared to have an asymptotic growth pattern with many age groups in the largest size-classes. Bathymetric demography reduces the potential for interspecific competition because shortspine and longspine thornyheads of similar size live at different depths. There are opportunities for refugium management in the fishery because eliminating fishing deeper than 600–800 m would protect the spawning biomass of thornyheads, Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus), and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria).},

	abstract = {100 years after Rosa Lee (1912) showed that higher mortality on faster growing fish can alter length-at-age distributions in fish populations, we present a computationally-efficient and parsimonious method for modeling size-selective mortality within a commonly-used assessment model, Stock Synthesis. Stock Synthesis allows the normal distribution of length-at-age to be partitioned into three or five overlapping platoons with slow, medium, or fast growth trajectories. The platoons are tracked separately in the model, and experience different degrees of size-selective fishing pressure and mortality, but are assumed to be unobservable except through changes in the length distribution. Simulations are used to explore this phenomenon in conjunction with dome-shaped selectivity, an alternative explanation for observing fewer than expected large fish in sampled data, but with very different implications for population productivity. For data simulated both with and without platoons, misspecification of the assumptions about growth are found to bias model results, with selectivity often incorrectly identified as the cause of fewer observations of larger fish. Trends in dome-shaped selectivity were explored as a potential diagnostic of model misspecification.},
