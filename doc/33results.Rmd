## Base Model Results


### Parameter Estimates
A complete set of parameter estimates are available in Table \ref{tab:allparstab}.

#### Recruitment
The model estimated 135 annual recruitment deviations (1901-2034) as well as the log of unfished recruitment $\ln(R_0)$. Unfished recruitment was estimated to be ~12,580,000 annual age-0 recruits ($\ln(R_0) = 9.44$) while annual log deviations were generally estimated between -0.5 and 0.5 (Figure \ref{fig:recdevs} ; Table \ref{tab:rec}). Recruitment in 2003 was estimated to be substantially larger than other years. As in the 2013 assessment, uncertainty in the scale of annual deviations was substantially larger than the variation between the deviations. Recruitment bias adjustments were performed following the advice of @methot_adjusting_2011.

#### Selectivity and Retention
Selectivity curves for all three fisheries fleets and the three scientific surveys were estimated as dome-shaped (Figure \ref{fig:selcurvs}). 

The early- and late-period \gls{s-tri}s had narrow dome-shapes, with peak selectivity occurring at relatively small length (~26 cm, and ~22 cm respectively). This shape is consistent with the design of the survey which focused its sampling on the relatively shallow shelf, where younger, smaller, `r spp` live before migrating to deeper waters as they age and mature . There was little difference in the estimated selectivity curves between male and female fish. Meanwhile, the \gls{s-wcgbt} was estimated to have a wide plateau (beginning at ~30cm) over which the species is fully selected for, including the lengths over which the species spends the bulk of its lifespan. This indicates that the \gls{s-wcgbt} is sampling a large proportion of the stock, and that annual length composition data from the survey is likely a good representation of the true distribution of lengths in the population. 

The North Trawl fleet was estimated to have a dome-shaped curve with a small plateau around 28 cm in length, and a long tail that spanned nearly the entire range of observed lengths. The South trawl fleet was estimated to have a very large selectivity plateau, (beginning at ~30cm and ranging from 30-55cm), with very steep ascending and descending limbs. Finally the Non-Trawl fleet was estimated to have a relatively small plateau beginning at a much higher length than any other fleet or survey (~45 cm). This can be explained by the fact that  hook and line gear, the dominant gear type in the  Non-Trawl fleet, selectively catches larger `r spp`. 

Retention curves for all three fisheries were asymptotic in shape, with the two trawl fisheries asymptoting at a retention value of 1.0 and the non-trawl fishery asymptoting a value just below 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:retencurvs}), indicating that the Non-Trawl fishery still discards large fish in limited cases. Retention was modeled in distinct time blocks to allow for better fits to the discard rate data. The time-blocked fits to the North Trawl fleet show the fishery to have begin retaining smaller fish in more recent years than they have historically. A similar pattern is observed for the South Trawl fleet, but to a much smaller extent (Figure \ref{fig:retencurvs}).

### Fits to the Data

#### Abundance Indices
The base model reasonably fit the available index data with the exception of the most recent two years of the \gls{s-wcgbt}. The fit to the \gls{s-tri} was relatively flat across the entire timeseries (1980-2004; Figure \ref{fig:fitsTri1}). An extra parameter was used to estimate additional variance beyond that estimated by the geostatistical model for this survey. The model fit to the \gls{s-wcgbt} indices appropriately captured the lack of trend in the early and middle portions of the timeseries, but struggled to fully capture the recent increase in abundance displayed by the indices (Figure \ref{fig:fitscombo}). The model fit for this survey only just falls within the estimated confidence interval for the 2021 and 2022 indices. This could be, in part, due to the lack of index data from 2020 (surveys were not conducted due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), which may have helped the model more accurately capture the increase.

#### Fishery Discard Rates
The model  fit the discard rates for all three fisheries fleets quite well (Figure \ref{fig:northtrl_disc}; Figure \ref{fig:southtrl_disc}; Figure \ref{fig:nontrl_disc}). The timeblocking scheme for retention that was inherited from the 2013 model was expanded to encompass a variety of additional changes in fishing behavior and observed patterns in the data. The final set of timeblocks are provided in Figure \ref{fig:timeblocks}, and justification for their use is presented in Section 3.2.4.2.  

#### Fishery Length Compositions
The base model fit the fishery and discard length compositions reasonably well in aggregate (Figure \ref{fig:lencomps_all}), though there was significant annual variability in the quality of fit, often due to differences in effective sample sizes. The South trawl and Non-trawl fleets were exceptionally well fit by the model, while the model fit to the length compositions from the North trawl fleet underestimated the scale of the peak of the distribution. This type of misfit was similarly observed in the model fits on an annual basis, with all years 2018-2022 displaying a similar underestimation of either the location or scale of the peak of the distribution (Figures \ref{fig:ntrawl_comps_1} - \ref{fig:ntrawl_comps_2}). The exact causes of this under-estimation remain unknown at this time, but could be due to subtle changes in selectivity or availability. Time-varying selectivity in the form selectivity time-blocks slightly improved overall fit to the length composition data. The final set of timeblocks are provided in Figure \ref{fig:timeblocks}, and justification for their use is presented in Section 3.2.4.2.

Trawl discards length compositions were well fit by the model in both the north and south regions, while the model struggled to adequately fit discard compositions from the Non-Trawl fleet (Figure \ref{fig:lencomps_all}). The Non-Trawl discards were of a larger size and were generally more dispersed than the discard compositions in the two trawl fleets, a feature the model did pick up on, but the model fit a wide plateau rather than narrow peak to these composition data. This is likely due to the wide variability in annual length compositions seen in this fleet, as well as the wide spatial coverage.

#### Survey Length Compositions
Like the fishery derived length compositions, survey-derived length compositions were reasonably well fit in aggregate by the base model (Figure \ref{fig:lencomps_all}), though there was considerable annual variability in the quality of the model fit (Figure \ref{fig:fits_wcgbts}). The early-period \gls{s-tri} length composition data for both sexes were exceptionally well fit by the model. Length compositions from the late-period Triennial survey were slightly less well fit, with the model under-estimating the location of the peak for both sexes. For the \gls{s-wcgbt} length compositions, the male, female, and unsexed location of the compositional peaks were well estimated, though the overall scales were slightly underestimated. Pearson residuals did not demonstrate any obvious trends that would indicate systematic misfits to the data (Figure \ref{fig:resids_survey}). 

#### Mean Body Weight 
Mean body weight of discarded fish was well fit in the two trawl fleets, and no major trends were observed in either the data of the model estimates (Figure \ref{fig:weightNorthTrl}; Figure \ref{fig:weightSouthTrl}; Figure \ref{fig:weightNonTrl}). Mean discard weight in the Non-Trawl fleet was observed to have increased in the last ten years, but this trend was not captured by the model. The model, instead, fit a declining trend in discard weight to the Non-Trawl fleet data (Figure \ref{fig:weightNonTrl}). The reason for this disparity between the observed data and the model fit is unclear.

### Population Trajectory
Unfished equilibrium spawning output ($B_0$) is estimated to be 22,145 trillion eggs (18,166-26,124 trillion eggs). The $B_0$ estimate is not directly comparable to estimates made in previous assessments, which assumed no fecundity relationship, and thus calculated $B_0$ in terms of biomass rather than egg production. Spawning output is estimated to have remained stable until the mid-1960s and then declined in the 1970s to about 80% in the mid-1980s, followed by a slower decline under the lower catch levels in the 2000s (Table \ref{tab:ts};  Figure \ref{fig:spawnout}). While the spawning output of the stock has declined near linearly since 1975, total biomass has stabilized in recent decades around ~85,000 mt. The estimated spawning output in 2023 is 8.717 trillion eggs (5.545-11.889 trillion eggs), which represents a stock status (depletion level) of 39% (32%-47%; Table \ref{tab:projections}, Figure \ref{fig:relspawnout}). The new depletion estimated for 2013 is 43.5%, which is significantly lower than the 74.2% estimated for 2013 in the previous assessment. 

Twelve-year projections predict that the population is unlikely to experience a large increase in spawning output or spawning biomass in the near future, if the full \gls{acl} is taken each year.
