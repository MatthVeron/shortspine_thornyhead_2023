## Summary of Previous Assessments and Reviews


### History of Modeling Approaches
`r Spp` was first assessed in 1990 by @jacobson_1990 and @jacobson_1991, and subsequently by @ianelli_etal_1991, @rogers_etal_1998, and @piner_methot_2001. What would now be called a data-moderate assessment was conducted in 2005 [@hamel_2005] using Stock Synthesis (SS2). More recently, `r spp` were assessed by @taylor_stephens_2013 using SS3. The 2013 model retained many of the assumptions made by @hamel_2005 including a four fisheries fleet structure, sex-specific growth, and no fecundity relationship. A catch-only projection was conducted in 2019 [@taylor_2019].


### Most Recent STAR Panel and SSC Recommendations

1. More investigation into maturity of `r spp`.
2. Information on possible migration of `r spp` would be valuable for understanding stock dynamics. 
3. A greater understanding of catchability of `r spp` would help define the scale of the populations..
4. Age data and additional research on ageing methods for thornyheads would be valuable.
5. A greater understanding of the connection between `r spp` and bottom type could be used to refine the indices of abundance. 
6. A comprehensive catch reconstruction for shortspine and longspine thornyheads should be completed to estimate landings for each species prior to 1981 in each of the three states.
7. Exploration of simpler assessment methods for `r spp` and evaluation of whether such methods would provide a more robust management strategy than the current approach. 
8. More tows or visual surveys south of 34.5 deg. N. lat. including the large \gls{cca}. Because the southern Conception Area is a large potential habitat for `r spp`, more sampling effort would help refine the estimations of their abundance in this area.

Recommendations from the last assessment were taken into consideration in the development of the current assessment model. New histological data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} in recent years enabled calculation of new maturity curves for the model. In addition, more comprehensive catch reconstructions from Washington, Oregon, and California were used for catches prior to 1980 in the model. Lastly, model structure for the current assessment was simplified by reducing the number of fishery and survey fleets.
