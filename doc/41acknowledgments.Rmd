# Acknowledgments
The West Coast `r spp` stock assessment was developed as part of the FISH 576/577 graduate course in Applied Stock Assessment at the University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fisheries Science (SAFS) in Spring 2023. This assessment would not have been possible without guidance from the course instructors, Vlada Gertseva, Kiva Oken, Owen Hamel, and Melissa Haltuch. This assessment draws heavily on the text and analyses from the 2019, 2013, and 2005 assessments and has benefited greatly from the efforts of all authors contributing to those analyses, including Owen Hamel, Ian Taylor, and Andi Stephens.

Additionally, we would like to acknowledge the many \gls{nwfsc}, state, and external partners who provided data and subject matter expertise to this assessment. They include the following: Donna Kline, who generously shared her own and John Butlerâ€™s experimental age data sets, which was used for growth estimation; Melissa Head, who provided updated maturity data for use in this assessment; Katherine Pearson, who assisted with interpretation of the differences between the historical and updated maturity curves; John Wallace, who provided discard data for the assessment; Kelli Johnson, who developed our model-based indices of abundance; Chantel Wetzel, who provided our modern commercial landings time series, and length compositions for the survey, commercial landings, and commercial discards; Julia Coates, Ali Whitman, and Theresa Tsou, who provided historical landings data for California, Oregon, and Washington, respectively; Andi Stephens, who provided WCGOP discard length compositions and discard mean weights; and to the numerous survey biologists, observers, and port samplers who collect data annually for use in stock assessments. 

Additionally, we would like to acknowledge the hard work of Kelli Johnson, Chantel Wetzel, and Ian Taylor, who collectively maintain several R packages that were used in the development of this assessment, and who were responsive to our many code and modeling questions throughout the class.
