## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment
The most notable changes from the previous assessment, conducted in 2013, include significant modifications to the fleet and survey structure, and major changes to the maturity and fecundity relationships that underlie the model’s biological assumptions. 

The 2013 assessment consisted of four fisheries fleets, and used information from four (nominally five) scientific surveys, while the new assessment uses a condensed structure consisting of just three fisheries fleets and only two (nominally three) surveys (see **section 3.2.2** for more details). 

This assessment assumes a new fecundity relationship, in which fecundity increases with body size, as well as a new maturity relationship, in which fish mature at much larger sizes and thus older ages, than were assumed in the 2013 assessment. Further details on the fecundity and maturity relationships can be found in **section 2.3.2**. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of different maturity assumptions on the final model output.

### Modeling Platform and Structure
This new assessment, including all exploratory models, profiles, and related analyses, was performed using Stock Synthesis Version 3.30.21 [@methot_stock_2013; @ss_manual_2020). The majority of analyses were performed using multiple recent versions of R [@r_core_2021], and relied heavily on the ‘r4ss’ R package [@r4ss] among others. The assessment model was developed and tested across multiple operating systems, including recent versions of Windows and macOS.

### Model Structure
Similarly to the 2013 assessment, the 2023 assessment model is a two-sex, length-based structured model that estimates population dynamics from 1901 onwards. The model assumes a steady equilibrium state with no fishing prior to the start year of the model (1901) and considers a spatially homogeneous unit stock in the waters off the U.S. West Coast.

Commercial fisheries landings were divided into three distinct fisheries fleets: a northern trawl fleet (hereinafter referred to as North Trawl) operating off the coasts of Oregon and Washington, a southern trawl fleet (hereinafter referred to as South Trawl) operating off the coast of California, and a coastwide non-trawl fleet (hereinafter referred to as Non-trawl).

Data from two fisheries-independent scientific surveys were used in this model: the \gls{s-tri} from 1980-2003, and the more recent \gls{s-wcgbt} from 2004-2022. The \gls{s-tri} was further divided into an early (pre-1995) and late period (post-1995) survey to account for the change in depth-sampling that occurred during the 1995 season. These two periods for the \gls{s-tri} were treated as separate surveys in the model. The contribution of each new data component to the changes in the assessment outcome was analyzed by data piecewise. 

### Model Parameters
There are 180 estimated parameters in this assessment. The log of unfished recruitment, $\ln(R_0)$, controls the overall scale of the population, while annual deviations in recruitment about the assumed stock-recruit relationship (135 parameters) allow for additional uncertainty in the population trajectory. Selectivity and retention parameters (43 parameters) for three fisheries fleets and three scientific surveys allow for estimation of annual length compositions and discards rates. Two catchability parameters are analytically computed from the data, and one additional parameter, representing additional variability in the early \gls{s-tri}, is directly estimated by the model.

#### Growth, Maturity, Fecundity, Mortality, and Recruitment
Growth, maturity, and fecundity parameters were fixed at values determined by external analyses (see **section 2.3** for more information). Due to a lack of aging data, growth could not be modeled internally by the assessment, though, like in the 2005 and 2013 models, there is no systematic misfit to the data suggesting that the externally derived growth curves were misspecified. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the overall effect of different assumptions regarding growth and maturity. 

For this assessment, natural mortality was fixed at a value of 0.04. A likelihood profile exploring alternative natural mortality values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:M_prof}). This marks a change from the 2013 assessment, where natural mortality was fixed at 0.0505 and a standard deviation on a log scale of 0.5361 [@taylor_stephens_2013].

As in the previous `r spp` assessment, a Beverton-Holt stock recruitment relationship was assumed. Unlike the 2013 assessment, where steepness was fixed at a value of 0.60, this assessment fixed steepness at 0.72, as recommended by @thorson_steepness_2019. A likelihood profile exploring alternative steepness parameters was conducted and the model results were found to be largely insensitive to the assumed value (Figure \ref{fig:h_spawnout}).

The overall scale of the population is estimated through the log of the initial recruitment parameter ($R_0$). Recruitment deviations were additionally estimated for the years 1901-2022. Recruitment bias adjustments were phased in beginning in 1950, and were adjusted by a factor of 0.75 in the years 1982-2022 [@taylor_hiding_2013]. The $\sigma_R$ parameter which controls the variability in recruitment deviations was fixed at 0.5 as in the previous assessment. Past assessments performed likelihood profiles over $\sigma_R$, finding the model results to be relatively insensitive to its value, and thus further profiles over the parameter were not conducted here.

#### Selectivity and Retention
Gear selectivity parameters used in this assessment were specified as a function of size with the additional assumption that age 0 fish were not selected, regardless of their size. Separate size-based selectivity curves were fit to each fishery fleet and survey. 

The selectivity curves for all fisheries and surveys were allowed to be dome-shaped and modeled with double-normal selectivity. The double-normal selectivity curve parameterization has six parameters, including: (1) peak, the length at which individuals are first fully selected, (2) width of the selectivity plateau, (3) width of the ascending part of the curve, (4) width of the descending part of the curve, (5) starting selectivity, and (6) final selectivity. Parameters 5 and 6 were not estimated and fixed at 0.0. The 2013 model allowed for all selectivity parameters to be estimated, regardless of whether one or more were estimated to be on the parameter bound. This model fixed parameter 2 (the plateau width) to the value of -15 for the North Trawl and Non-trawl fleets to alleviate them hitting the lower parameter bound. Though exploratory models run with the plateau width on its lower bound still converged, fixing the parameter had negligible impact on the fits to the length composition data for those fleets. Sex-specific selectivity curves were fit to the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri} length composition data.

As a new exploration in this assessment, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the response of the model to time-varying selectivity peak for trawl fleets. Different combinations of time blocks were considered, all designed to account for potential structural chanegs in these fisheries: 2003, for the implement of marine protected areas, 2011 for the start of the \gls{ifq} program and 2020 for potential COVID-induced changes in fisheries dynamics.

Retention curves are defined as a logistic function of size. These are controlled by four parameters: (1) inflection, (2) slope, (3) asymptotic retention, and (4) male offset to inflection. Male offset to retention was fixed at 0 (i.e. no male offset was applied). The parameters for inflection and asymptotic retention (asymptotic retention was estimated for North Trawl and Non-Trawl, and fixed for South Trawl as estimate was hitting the upper parameter bound ) were modeled as time-varying quantities via use of time blocks, as was done in the 2013 assessment. Both North Trawl and South Trawl fleets were broken into the same three periods as in the 2013 assessment: (1) 1901–2006, (2) 2007–2010, (3) 2011–2022. The first break was based on observation of a strong reduction in discard rates for both North and South Trawl in this year, while the later break was associated with the beginning of the \gls{ifq} program. After merging the two Non-Trawl fleets previously considered in the 2013, the reasons that justified the time blocks used in the 2013 assessment were not pertinent anymore and we decided not to represent time-varying retention for this fleet.

Alternative retention blocking schemes were investigated as part of a sensitivity analysis. Notably, a sequence of shorter time blocks starting after 2007 was investigated in order to better fit noticeably lower discards rates in the mid 2010s. Additionally, a short, 3-year, timeblock for the years 2020 and 2022 was also attempted, as discard rates were noticeably higher in those years than in previous.

#### Catchability
Catchability coefficients (q) were calculated for each of the two survey abundance time series. Unlike in the 2013 model, which estimated catchability for each survey, this model computes catchability analytically for each survey using the Stock Synthesis “floatQ” option [@ss_manual_2020]. 

This model depends on the assumptions that thornyheads are long-lived, slow-growing, and relatively sedentary groundfish. They are assumed to represent a single stock within the area considered for this assessment. If the assumptions about growth, natural mortality, or stock structure turn out to be far from the true life history and ecology of `r spp`s, this assessment will be highly inaccurate.
