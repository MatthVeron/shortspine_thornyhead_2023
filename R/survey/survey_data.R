# Note from Vladlena.Gertseva@noaa.gov 2023-01-20: Unlike NWFSC surveys, bio data files
# from AFSC surveys include two tables (for Length and Ages), and you will need
# to specify a table (bio = bio$Lengths) to run the expansion portion of the
# nwfscSurvey code. This applies to Triennial and AFSC Slope surveys (two
# historical surveys conducted by AFSC).
