# This analysis has been developed based on the following models: 
# New model 	 Base model
# 23.model.fleetstruct_1 	 23.model.recdevs_bias 
# 23.model.fleetstruct_2 	 23.model.recdevs_bias 
# 23.model.fleetstruct_3 	 23.model.recdevs_bias 
# 23.model.fleetstruct_4 	 23.model.recdevs_bias 
# 23.model.fleetstruct_5 	 23.model.recdevs_bias 
# 
# Results are stored in the following foler:

# 
# General features: 
# We are testing different possible combinations of fisheries fleet and surveys to potentially reduce model complexity 
# 
# Model features:
# - Model 23.model.fleetstruct_1:
# 23.model.recdevs_bias + Three fleets, no slope surveys, and model-based indices 
# - Model 23.model.fleetstruct_2:
# 23.model.recdevs_bias + Three fleets, use slope surveys, and model-based indices 
# - Model 23.model.fleetstruct_3:
# 23.model.recdevs_bias + Four fleets, use slope survey, and model-based indices 
# - Model 23.model.fleetstruct_4:
# 23.model.recdevs_bias + Four fleets, no slope surveys, and model-based indices 
# - Model 23.model.fleetstruct_5:
# 23.model.recdevs_bias + Three fleets, no slope survey, and model-based indices
