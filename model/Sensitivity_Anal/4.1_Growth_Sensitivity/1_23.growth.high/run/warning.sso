Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 72  < max pop len bins: 90; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Note 2 Suggestion: Are you sure you want so few early recrdevs? Better to include in range of main recdevs 1
Warning 1 : Maximum pop size bin:_90; is within 5% of L at maxage for sex: 1; Gpat: 1 settle: 1; L= 94.0797
Warning 2 : Final gradient: 0.000145984 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Warning 3 : Time-vary parms not bound checked
Warning 4 : Reminder: Number of lamdas !=0.0 and !=1.0:  2
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 2; check results, variance may be suspect
