# This analysis has been developed based on the following models: 
# New model 	 Base model
# 23.model.sample_sizes 	 23.model.settlement_events 
# 23.model.sexed_survey_selectivity 	 23.model.sample_sizes 
# 23.model.improve_trawln 	 23.model.sexed_survey_selectivity 
# 23.model.improve_other 	 23.model.improve_trawln

# Results are stored in the following foler:

# Name of the script used to analyze the results from this model:

# 
# General features: 
# Improve fits to length composition data by modifying estimated selectivity parameters and remove poor data. This includes removing LCs where sample sizes are <11.5, using sex-specific selectivities for survey length comps, and modifying selectivity pars for the fisheries fleets. 
# 
# Model features:
# - Model 23.model.sample_sizes:
# 23.model.settlement_events + remove small sample size LCs 
# - Model 23.model.sexed_survey_selectivity:
# 23.model.sample_sizes + use sex-specific survey selectivities 
# - Model 23.model.improve_trawln:
# 23.model.sexed_survey_selectivity + improve Trawl_N fits 
# - Model 23.model.improve_other:
# 23.model.improve_trawln + improve fits to other fleet LCs
