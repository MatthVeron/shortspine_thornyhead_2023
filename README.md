# 2023 Shortspine Thornyhead Stock Assessment
## File Structure 
`data/` - This directory holds any and all data that is direct requested from state/federal agencies or pulled from NOAA servers (ie. survey data). Data that gets output from other analyses (ie. a lot of the SS inputs) are stored somewhere else.

`data/raw/` - Completely raw, unedited, data from various data sources. This folder is untracked and is safe to place confidential data in.

`data/processed/` - Processed data from available data sources. This folder IS tracked, so no confidential data, only cleaned datasets ready for analysis. Every file in this directory should have an equivalent "raw" data file in data/raw.

`R/` - This directory should hold R scripts and analyses. These can take the form of either runnable .R scripts or .Rmd Rmarkdown documents/notebooks. Note that data outputs/plots should not be stored in this directory. This directory is further broken down into subdirectories based on data type ('bio/', 'comps/', 'discards/', 'landings/', and 'survey/'). Data type specific analyses and script should live in their relevant subdirectories rather than the root R/ directory.

`R/utils/` - Any utility functions that may be of use across R analyses can go here. For example, plotting code, or helpful data cleaning functions.

`model/` - This directory will (in the future) hold the stock synthesis model code.

`outputs/` - Send all outputs (including plots and potential SS input files) generated by other analyses to this directory. There is no defined directory structure for this directory at this time, so be thoughtful as to directory and file names when you send outputs here.
